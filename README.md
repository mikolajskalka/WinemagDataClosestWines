# WinemagDataClosestWines

Here is a notebook from my datascience classes where I was trying out use of count vectorizer and different metrics of calculating distance between vectors.
I was using wine reviews data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews?select=winemag-data-130k-v2.csv) as I am personaly a little bit into wines so I was wondering if it is possible to find a metric that is useful in finding similar wine based on the review.
